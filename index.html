  <h1>This my website for CIS 155 which focuses on Front End Web Development.</h1>
  
    <p> My name is Kam and this is my website. I can't really explain what it is all about because I'm building on it still.</p>
    <p> This is my first actual coded web project that I have made and it hasn't been too bad to make.</p>
    <p> I wasn't really sure what to put here initially, but the progression of the website began as a diary of sorts to track my work from week to week.</p>
    <p> This has been created with Visual Studio Code and has had some help with the Github copilot to ensure things work, or if they break, to find where and why. I think they call this vibe coding.</p>
 <p> My cat has broken my code so many times by jumping on me or the keyboard to get my attention.</p>

      <p> I've been listening to them for... over 10 years now. I've seen them in concert a few times too. Most of their music is marked as explicit. </p>

      <p> This has been a weird hyperfocus that I've had for about a year now, I can't really explain why I like the game so much. But the lore is insteresting and I could yap about it for hours.</p>
    <p> Placeholder for now I will probably actually yap about this eventually.</p>

    <div id="digital-media" class="hyperfixation-content" style="display:none;">
      <header> <strong>Computers and Video Games</strong></header>
      <p> Most of my time that isn't spent working or sleeping is generally spent on my PC. I play video games and occasionally will create things with Adobe.</p>
      <p> I've gotten pretty familiar using Adobe Creative Cloud over the past few years and have an interest in digital media.</p>
      <p> Video games are what I do most on this PC however but I did upgrade it to better run Adobe as I was starting to bluescreen and drop frames with my last one.</p>
      <p> I got my PC custom made about a year ago now and hope it will be futureproofed at least partly for a few years.</p>

        <h2>This is the start of my assignments, it's janky.</h2>
        <p> This is a test page. Kind of, it became more like a diary of the progression of this site. </p>
        <p>I tried to log everything I did while I progressed it. I guess it kind of worked. </p>
        <p> Today is <strong>10/4/25</strong></p>
        <p> I am using Visual Studio Code to make these since it's easier to read. Apparently the more spread out an HTML thing is, the larger the file becomes. But at least it's more legible.</p>

            <li> Github took 5 minutes to redeploy my original edits.</li>
            <li> So I'm trying this to see if it'll redeploy</li>
            <li> If you're reading this it means that it decided to work.</li>

        <p> This part of Week 3 assignment they wanted me to add an embed link so I used the song I was listening to at the time to link because I couldn't really think of anything else to add.</p>
        <p> The song I had been listening to was Warcry by Chase Atlantic. Released on <strong>October 3rd, 2025</strong>. It had just come out at the time of writing this.</p>
        <p>

<p> Today is <strong>10/15/25</strong> And we're starting CSS. And stuff for our final project. So I changed a bunch of things.

        <li> First of all, I made it multi tabbed for the final project work/other assignments with help the VSC copilot. I wanted it to be kind of a diary of sorts this page.</li>
        <li> Then I used that code to make a base layout for the website. It's still pretty mid.</li>
        <li> I actually changed the html file from the original index.html cause I forgot what I had done with it and figured it would just be easier to move it to a tab with the template I had made. </li>
        <li> This failed and broke everything so I had to change it back. But it's fine now.</li>
        <li> Edited some colors, moved the other stuff, deleted the old html. Hopefully github doesn't have a panic attack, turns out it did.</li>
        <li> I added basic things and moved things to this tab and will have to go back and think of what stuff to fill the other ones with.</li>
        <li> I have no idea where I'm supposed to use the stylesheet rather than the web.css file but I guess I'll figure it out at some point or just only use the web.css one.</li>
      </p>
  <p> <strong>10/21/25:</strong> We are unlucky and there was an AWS outage so Canvas was down on Monday 10/20/25 And then right before that, between 10/13/25 and 10/18/25 all of OC was down so we couldn't use Canvas then either. We're almost to midterms, unfortunate.</p>

  <p> <strong>10/23/25:</strong> I've made my fugly website thing kind of, it's hard to make because it physically hurts my eyes to look at. The problem with having multiple pages is that everything is cramped together.
    I also have the memory retention of a goldfish. So I can't actually remember how to do anything. And my HTML file here is getting crowded and it's getting harder to read even like this.
  </p>
  <p> <strong>11/1/25:</strong> I am struggling with balancing everything, between my midterm and work and home life. I was at work all of yesterday and finally have a day off but I have a lot to do. I don't know what I was thinking. </p>
 <p> On Thursday, my mom got scammed by a person impersonating the new pastor at church through email. That was kind of rough cause I was taking my midterm when my mom realized it and she and my dad argued for a long time about it. I WARNED HER that it was suspicious.</p>
 <p> I need a nap.</p>

<p> <strong>11/8/25:</strong> Okay, it's time to start on my final project template, like bare minimum for someone to be able to look at. I don't know what I'd write about, so we're just going to make this however my brain will let me.</p>
<p> <strong>11/9/25:</strong> I made my basic template, I don't know if it's weird if I do my project like this. But I can't really think of anything else since my brain is just full of hyper fixations right now. I think it's just how my brain is coping so I don't have another meltdown.</p>
<p> <strong>11/12/25:</strong> Adding a bit more and fixing the layout of my website before class. I slept most of yesterday and worked Monday so I haven't been able to get everything done.</p>
<p> <strong>11/15/25:</strong> Continuing to work on my final project, but I do have some MEDA terminology homework to do as well. Didn't have the energy to actually do anything after work yesterday so today we will play catch up.</p>
<p> Someone had suggested to me that I use a branch on Github to see my edits and progression before I actually committed them because my code has so much stuff in it now. I don't think I did it right so we're not gonna try that.</p>
