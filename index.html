  <h1>This my website for CIS 155 which focuses on Front End Web Development.</h1>
  
    <p> My name is Kam and this is my website. I can't really explain what it is all about because I'm building on it still.</p>
    <p> This is my first actual coded web project that I have made and it hasn't been too bad to make.</p>
    <p> I wasn't really sure what to put here initially, but the progression of the website began as a diary of sorts to track my work from week to week.</p>
    <p> This has been created with Visual Studio Code and has had some help with the Github copilot to ensure things work, or if they break, to find where and why. I think they call this vibe coding.</p>
 <p>I don't have anything else to put here, so here is a photo of my cat.</p>

      <header> <strong>Chase Atlantic.</strong></header>
      <p>Chase Atlantic is band formed in 2014 in Cairns, Queensland located in Australia. They are comprised of three members, Mitchel and Clinton Caven and Christian Anthony. They are currently signed to Fearless Records and operate under their own label. In the past they have worked with both Warner Bros. Records and BMG. </p>
      <p>They do not have a specific genre of music however, they are often described as alternative R&B, pop rock, and synth pop.</p>
      <p> I created a table of their discography. They have released seven EPs and four albums. As well as putting songs out as singles that we would see on albums later, which I will not be including.</p>

      <p> Most of my time that isn't spent working or sleeping is generally spent on my PC. I play video games and occasionally will create things with Adobe.</p>
      <p> I've gotten pretty familiar using Adobe Creative Cloud over the past few years and have an interest in digital media.</p>
      <p> Video games are what I do most on this PC however but I did upgrade it to better run Adobe as I was starting to bluescreen and drop frames with my last one.</p>
      <p> I got my PC custom made about a year ago now and hope it will be futureproofed at least partly for a few years.</p>

      <h1>Now that you've seen my interests, here's what happens when they blend together.</h1>
          <p> I create videos in Adobe Premiere Pro sometimes when I have a brain worm to do so. It's been interesting to see how my editing skills have evolved over time.</p>
    </header>

 <p> These are my Love And Deepspace videos:</p>
<p>This is the first Love And Deepspace video I made using Chase Atlantic's song Doubt It, the focus of this video is Sylus:

        <p> Today is <strong>10/4/25</strong></p>
        <p> I am using Visual Studio Code to make these since it's easier to read. Apparently the more spread out an HTML thing is, the larger the file becomes. But at least it's more legible.</p>

        <p> This part of Week 3 assignment they wanted me to add an embed link so I used the song I was listening to at the time to link because I couldn't really think of anything else to add.</p>
        <p> The song I had been listening to was Warcry by Chase Atlantic. Released on <strong>October 3rd, 2025</strong>. It had just come out at the time of writing this.</p>

<p> Today is <strong>10/15/25</strong> And we're starting CSS. And stuff for our final project. So I changed a bunch of things.

        <li> First of all, I made it multi tabbed for the final project work/other assignments with help the VSC copilot. I wanted it to be kind of a diary of sorts this page.</li>
        <li> Then I used that code to make a base layout for the website. It's still pretty mid.</li>
        <li> I actually changed the html file from the original index.html cause I forgot what I had done with it and figured it would just be easier to move it to a tab with the template I had made. </li>
        <li> This failed and broke everything so I had to change it back. But it's fine now.</li>
        <li> Edited some colors, moved the other stuff, deleted the old html. Hopefully github doesn't have a panic attack, turns out it did.</li>
        <li> I added basic things and moved things to this tab and will have to go back and think of what stuff to fill the other ones with.</li>
        <li> I have no idea where I'm supposed to use the stylesheet rather than the web.css file but I guess I'll figure it out at some point or just only use the web.css one.</li>
      </p>
  <p> <strong>10/21/25:</strong> We are unlucky and there was an AWS outage so Canvas was down on Monday 10/20/25 And then right before that, between 10/13/25 and 10/18/25 all of OC was down so we couldn't use Canvas then either. We're almost to midterms, unfortunate.</p>

  <p> <strong>10/23/25:</strong> I've made my fugly website thing kind of, it's hard to make because it physically hurts my eyes to look at. The problem with having multiple pages is that everything is cramped together.
    I also have the memory retention of a goldfish. So I can't actually remember how to do anything. And my HTML file here is getting crowded and it's getting harder to read even like this.
  </p>
  <p> <strong>11/1/25:</strong> I am struggling with balancing everything, between my midterm and work and home life. I was at work all of yesterday and finally have a day off but I have a lot to do. I don't know what I was thinking. </p>
 <p> On Thursday, my mom got scammed by a person impersonating the new pastor at church through email. That was kind of rough cause I was taking my midterm when my mom realized it and she and my dad argued for a long time about it. I WARNED HER that it was suspicious.</p>
 <p> I need a nap.</p>

<p> <strong>11/8/25:</strong> Okay, it's time to start on my final project template, like bare minimum for someone to be able to look at. I don't know what I'd write about, so we're just going to make this however my brain will let me.</p>
<p> <strong>11/9/25:</strong> I made my basic template, I don't know if it's weird if I do my project like this. But I can't really think of anything else since my brain is just full of hyper fixations right now. I think it's just how my brain is coping so I don't have another meltdown.</p>
<p> <strong>11/12/25:</strong> Adding a bit more and fixing the layout of my website before class. I slept most of yesterday and worked Monday so I haven't been able to get everything done.</p>
<p> <strong>11/15/25:</strong> Continuing to work on my final project, but I do have some MEDA terminology homework to do as well. Didn't have the energy to actually do anything after work yesterday so today we will play catch up.</p>
<p> Someone had suggested to me that I use a branch on Github to see my edits and progression before I actually committed them because my code has so much stuff in it now. I don't think I did it right so we're not gonna try that.</p>
<p> <strong>11/17/25</strong> I added images and then had to resize them and made them look a little nicer.</p>
<p> <strong>11/19/25:</strong> I've added some colour and icons to my website, I don't really know what other colours I want to add that won't look wonky. </p>
<p> <strong>11/22/25</strong> Okay, peer review thing. I didn't get any peer reviews so I asked my coworkers for input. I am also currently sick. Terrible timing.</p> 
<p> <strong>11/23/25</strong> I didn't get the peer review all the way done, so I'm working on that. I also decided to add the table in the Love And Deepspace dropdown. Though it might be easier to put it in the Chase Atlantic one, so I might put it there instead. I think I'm having a bronchitis flare up.</p>
<p> But I do work tomorrow so that is going to be unpleasent.</p>
<p> <strong>11/24/25</strong> I added the table to the Chase Atlantic section instead, it made more sense there. I also fixed some of the formatting that was a bit off.</p>
<p> <strong>11/29/25</strong> Okay, so between holiday and working, I am editing some more stuff on my site for the final peer review. I requested the next few days off so I'm able to finish this up to a satisfactory level.</p>
