      <h2>I don't actually know what to put here. But these colours are something. I've used hexcode for them cause that works as long as you make it all lowercase. <br>

        I think my biggest issue here is that I know what I want to do and how to do it, I just don't know where it goes exactly cause I'm dumb. And tired.

      <h2>This is the start of my assignments, it's janky.</h2>
      <p> This is a test page. Kind of, it became more like a diary of the progression of this site. </p>
      <p>I tried to log everything I did while I progressed it. I guess it kind of worked. </p>
      <p> Today is 10/4/25</p>
      <p> I am using Visual Studio Code to make these since it's easier to read. Apparently the more spread out an HTML thing is, the larger the file becomes. But at least it's more legible.</p>

      <ul>
          <li> Github took 5 minutes to redeploy my original edits.</li>
          <li> So I'm trying this to see if it'll redeploy</li>
          <li> If you're reading this it means that it decided to work.</li>
          <li> In which case... yippee.</li>

      <p> This part of Week 3 assignment they wanted me to add an embed link so I used the song I was listening to at the time to link because I couldn't really think of anything else to add.</p>
      <p> The song I had been listening to was Warcry by Chase Atlantic. Released on October 3rd, 2025. It had just come out at the time of writing this.</p>

<p> Today is 10/15/25 And we're starting CSS. And stuff for our final project. So I changed a bunch of things.

        <li> First of all, I made it multi tabbed for the final project work/other assignments with help the VSC copilot. I wanted it to be kind of a diary of sorts this page.</li>
        <li> Then I used that code to make a base layout for the website. It's still pretty mid.</li>
        <li> I actually changed the html file from the original index.html cause I forgot what I had done with it and figured it would just be easier to move it to a tab with the template I had made. </li>
        <li> This failed and broke everything so I had to change it back. But it's fine now.</li>
        <li> Edited some colors, moved the other stuff, deleted the old html. Hopefully github doesn't have a panic attack, turns out it did.</li>
        <li> I added basic things and moved things to this tab and will have to go back and think of what stuff to fill the other ones with.</li>
        <li> I have no idea where I'm supposed to use the stylesheet rather than the web.css file but I guess I'll figure it out at some point or just only use the web.css one.</li>
      </p>
  <p> 10/21/25: We are unlucky and there was an AWS outage so Canvas was down on Monday 10/20/25. And then right before that, between 10/13/25 and 10/18/25 all of OC was down so we couldn't use Canvas then either. We're almost to midterms, unfortunate.</p>

  <p> 10/23/25: I've made my fugly website thing kind of, it's hard to make because it physically hurts my eyes to look at. The problem with having multiple pages is that everything is cramped together.
    I also have the memory retention of a goldfish. So I can't actually remember how to do anything. And my HTML file here is getting crowded and it's getting harder to read even like this.
