    <p>This my website for CIS 155. It's just the progression of my assignments and projects throughout the course. It's going to be mid.</p>

  <div id="Fugly Webpage" class="tabcontent">
    <h2>This is the page for the fugly website thing.</h2>
    <p>Shouldn't be too hard since everything I've made has turned out kind fugly tbh. </p>

      <h1>The progression of my assignments</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <h2>This is the start of my assignments, it's janky.</h2>
      <p> This is a test page. Kind of, it became more like a diary of the progression of this site. </p>
      <p>I tried to log everything I did while I progressed it. I guess it kind of worked. </p>
      <p> Today is 10/4/25</p>
      <p> I am using Visual Studio Code to make these since it's easier to read. Apparently the more spread out an HTML thing is, the larger the file becomes. But at least it's more legible.</p>

      <ul>
          <li> Github took 5 minutes to redeploy my original edits.</li>
          <li> So I'm trying this to see if it'll redeploy</li>
          <li> If you're reading this it means that it decided to work.</li>
          <li> In which case... yippee.</li>
      </ul>

      <p> This part of Week 3 assignment they wanted me to add an embed link so I used the song I was listening to at the time to link because I couldn't really think of anything else to add..</p>
      <p> The song I had been listening to was Warcry by Chase Atlantic. Released on October 3rd, 2025. It had just come out at the time of writing this.</p>

<p> Today is 10/15/25 And we're starting CSS. And stuff for our final project. So I changed a bunch of things.

        <li> First of all, I made it multi tabbed for the final project work/other assignments with help of AI. It's kind of a diary of sorts this page.</li>
        <li> Then I used that code to make a base layout for the website. It's still pretty mid.</li>
        <li> I actually changed the html file from the original index.html cause I forgot what I had done with it and figured it would just be easier to move it to a tab with the template I had made. </li>
        <li> This actually failed and broke everything so I had to change it back. But it's fine now.</li>
        <li> Edited some colors, moved the other stuff, deleted the old html. Hopefully github doesn't have a panic attack.</li>
        <li> I added basic things and moved things to this tab and will have to go back and think of what stuff to fill the other ones with.</li>
        <li> I have no idea where I'm supposed to use the stylesheet rather than the web.css file but I guess I'll figure it out.</li>
</p>
  <p> Today is 10/21/25: I'm working on my fugly website thing. The whole site probably will end up like that. But that tab will be specifically for that.
There was an AWS outage yesterday and everything was so broken. Including Canvas and Zoom so that wasn't great to get anytthing done. I was at work anyway so it didn't really do much on my end except for the fact that there was a Canvas outage at the school last week so I couldn't get into anything there either so. Unlucky.
