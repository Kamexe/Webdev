Feedback Critique #1


Okay, so I didn’t get feedback from my peer review so I ended up asking my coworkers for their thoughts and critiques at work. I pulled up my website on one of the computers, and asked them to look at it and give me their thoughts on the design. Some of the suggestions I was given were to change the colors of my default tabs as they were too dark on our crappy computer screen at work so it was hard to read before you hovered on it. So I changed the color there to be a lighter shade. The other suggestion was to make my icons a little bit larger, but I’m not entirely sure how to do that without breaking everything. They also suggested I added something as a background which I did, but kept the foreground the same, this is just a placeholder image though most likely but I thought I’d try it. I also tested out page specific backgrounds. They didn’t have any comments on the code itself, the pharmacist on duty has worked with HTML and he remembered how many lines there could be. He hadn’t worked with css so he didn’t have any input on that. They also said maybe I could mess with fonts like I did on my top one but I would worry that would be distracting.


The icon could be an issue with what I selected as there were limited options for the free version to choose from, this one I thought looked nice because it was bold but since the tabs aren’t very large, it makes sense why he thought it would look better if it was larger since they kind of look like a blob because the computer we were viewing it on is not high resolution and the light panel of the screen is old and kind of trash. So I might want to either figure out how to resize it or alternatively, to find a different icon that isn’t bold but still gets the point across.
